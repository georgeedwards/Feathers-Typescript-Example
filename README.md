Feathers Typescript Example

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/georgeedwards/Feathers-Typescript-Example.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/georgeedwards/Feathers-Typescript-Example)

To support the addition of Typescript to the Feathers ecosystem, we are working on bringing TS support to the feathers CLI. This repo stands as an example of the application we want to build - it should also act as an example for how to use TS and Feathers together.
